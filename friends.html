                         My childhood friend and I have shared an incredible bond for over 20 years, filled with countless memories and experiences that have shaped our lives.
                         From our early days of school to growing up together, we were always there for each other, supporting one another through both good times and challenges. 
                         Our friendship has always been built on trust, laughter, and mutual understanding.
                         In 2023, my friend got married, and soon after, they moved to Johor. 
                         While this change has led to us seeing each other less frequently, the distance has not diminished the strength of our connection. 
                         Despite the physical distance, we continue to stay in touch and share updates about our lives, reminding each other of the love and friendship that has always existed between us.
                        Although we miss the times we spent together, the memories we've created over the years remain close to my heart, and I know that no matter where life takes us, our friendship will always endure.</p>

                    <p>I first met my childhood friend as classmates at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Undang Rembau,Negeri Sembilan. We have been friends for 10 years. 
                       During our time in school, we created countless fun and unforgettable memories together.
                       After school, one of our favorite things to do was grab a meal at KFC, where we‚Äôd talk and laugh for hours.
                       Our friendship grew stronger as we shared experiences like studying for exams, participating in school events, and navigating the ups and downs of teenage life. 
                       These moments helped form the strong bond we share today.
                       Even now, we still laugh about those carefree days, and the memories from high school continue to bring us closer, no matter where life takes us.

                <p>I met my diploma friends at UiTM Rembau, Negeri Sembilan which is when we were assigned as groupmates for various group assignments from Semester 1 to Semester 5. 
                   Over the course of our studies, we became a close-knit group, supporting each other through every challenge.
                   We shared many memories such as working late nights to finish assignments, studying together for exams, and celebrating small victories along the way. 
                   It wasn‚Äôt just about academics; it was also about the laughter, and the sense of teamwork that helped us push through.
                   As we near the end of our diploma journey, I find myself reflecting on how much I will miss them.
                   Our time as diploma students has been a beautiful chapter in my life, filled with growth and friendship.
                   I will cherish the memories we‚Äôve made and hope that, no matter where life takes us, we will remain friends for years to come.

                    <p><strong>Group Name:</strong> Aula, Farah, Qila, Aisyah, Esah, Insyi & Nurin</p>
                    <p>I met my housemate when we both moved into the UiTM Rembau college in Semester 1.
                         At first, we were both shy and hesitant to talk to each other, but as time passed, we began to bond over small, everyday moments. 
                         We shared food, watched movies together, and even took turns cleaning the toilet, making it feel like a shared responsibility and a fun part of our daily routine. 
                         Hanging out after classes became something we looked forward to, and our friendship grew stronger with each passing day.
                         We only lived together for 2 semesters, as we were assigned to different houses in the following semesters. 
                         Though we didn‚Äôt see each other as much after that, the memories we made during our time together will always stay with me. 
                         From the laughter-filled moments to the simple joys of sharing meals and stories, these experiences have created a lasting bond between us. 
                         Despite the distance, I know that our friendship will never fade. We may not have shared a house for long, but the memories we created will always be a cherished part of my university life.
